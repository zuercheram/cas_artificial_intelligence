# Python Environment

I run the Notebooks in an Anaconda environment. The env file is located in the **environment** folder.

Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) according to the documentation. Create a new environment using the .yml file.

`conda env create -f ./environment/conda_environment.yml`

The environment from the yml file is labeled **ai**. To activate the env use:

`conda activate ai`
